# NBSINFRA_Generic-ABM
The generic model is a practical realization of the proposed Resilience and Sustainability Quantification Framework methodology, designed to assess the impact of Nature-Based Solutions projects on urban resilience and sustainability. Its primary objective is to quantitatively evaluate specific NBS projects using modeling elements like agent typology, spatial resolution, and temporal resolution.
Key characteristics of the generic model include:
•	Purpose | To evaluate the resilience and sustainability of NBS projects and demonstrate the RSQF's applicability in real-world contexts.
•	Modeling Framework | It integrates representative ecosystem functions and their impacts through formalized procedures executed by agents within a simulated 3D environment.
•	Components | The model features static components (patches) representing the built environment, ground, underground, and air, and dynamic components (agents) such as flora, fauna, and community agents.
•	Assessment | It assesses both the system's performance across various dimensions (e.g., vegetation condition, air quality) and the values of selected ecosystem services.
•	Interface | A user-friendly interface allows users to define environmental specifications, select indicators, customize parameters, and monitor simulations in real-time.
•	Scenarios | The model allows for the exploration of alternative operational conditions, including different NBS infrastructure types (e.g., rain gardens, bioswales) and disruptive events (e.g., rainstorm, drought), generating up to 12 distinct simulation scenarios.
